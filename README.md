# Oops

Slack bot for help with incident management. This is totally a work in progress and very early on at that.
I.e. it doesn’t really do anything yet. The idea is that this bot can automate some of the bookkeeping and
history gathering around an incident by doing things like creating a JIRA ticket and maybe a dedicated Slack
channel for working the incident while also maybe being able to help redirect people who pop into the main
incident-management channel asking what’s up.
